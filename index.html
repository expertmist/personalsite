<h5>
Aspiring Financial Advisor</h5>
<p>
I am pursuing a finance degree at Lewis University, and studying for the series 65 exam. I am an eagle scout and have been practicing MMA for over ten years. Both experiences have provided an invaluable amount of information and character development. I hope to make a successful career for myself, and do so while providing a useful and convenient service for clients.</p>
